#+TITLE: Glogi DCE Demonstration
#+AUTHOR: rome-user
#+LANGAUGE: en

This repository produces a minimal working example of DCE failing with Glogi
unless some modifications are made to a private ~log-expr~ function.

* Getting started

If you are using Emacs, you can =M-x cider-jack-in-cljs= then choose the =:demo=
build target. Once a REPL is opened, visit the following URLs in your web
browser.

- http://localhost:9630
- http://localhost:8080

The first link is Shadow CLJS console. The second link is a webpage with very
minimal layout and code.

Use the Shadow CLJS console to quickly switch between development and release
builds and compare output. Unfortunately, Shadow CLJS must be restarted to try
out the example code below with the modified Glogi library.

* Example code

#+begin_src clojure
(defn ^:export init []
  (let [message (js/document.createElement "p")]
    (set! (.-innerText message)
          (if ^boolean goog.DEBUG
            "You are in a development build. Logging is expected."
            (str "You are in a release build.\n"
                 "Check the compiled JS file for traces of log strings.")))
    (js/document.body.appendChild message))
  (log/trace :message "You should not see me in your release build!"))
#+end_src

** Release build output

*** Without modifications

#+begin_src javascript
  function eg() {
    var a = document.createElement("p");
    a.innerText = "You are in a release build.\nCheck the compiled JS file for traces of log strings.";
    document.body.appendChild(a);
    a = new kb(null,2,[Ke, "You should not see me in your release build!", Je, 13],null);
    if (w(!1))
      if (Af("demo.core"),
	  w(null)) {
	var b = Bb.h(dg, pf);
	a = new ("undefined" !== typeof aa && "undefined" !== typeof fa && "undefined" !== typeof fa.zb ? fa.zb : vf)(b,a,"demo.core");
	a = "undefined" !== typeof aa && "undefined" !== typeof qf && "undefined" !== typeof wf ? void 0 : null.kc(a)
      } else
	a = null;
    else
      a = null;
    return a
  }
